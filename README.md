Greetings to whomever reads this note, this repositery was created to house files for the school project I'm still working on at slow pace. My current and last remaining objective is to inplement a scoring system.

The files and game project itself is the replica of the famous game "Tic-Tac-Toe". I don't think I should explain the premise of the game, but if you are unaware of it and just found out about it, I'd advise you to search it up on Google/whichever search engine you utilize.
